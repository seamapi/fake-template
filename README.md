# Fake Template

[![GitHub Actions](https://github.com/seamapi/fake-template/actions/workflows/check.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seamapi/fake-template/actions/workflows/check.yml)

Package skeleton for a fake.

## Description

TODO: Describe fake here.

## Bootstrapping a new fake

1. [Trigger a makenew workflow from this repository][makenew workflow]. ðŸš€
   - Provide a value for each required input.
   - There are no defaults.
   - Example values are shown in parentheses.
2. When the workflow completes, clone your new repo and start coding!

### Updating from this skeleton

If you want to pull in future updates from this skeleton,
you can fetch and merge in changes from this repository.

Add this as a new remote with

```
$ git remote add makenew git@github.com:seamapi/fake-template.git
```

You can then fetch and merge changes with

```
$ git fetch --no-tags makenew
$ git merge makenew/main
```

## Third Party API Fakes

Third party APIs are simulated in testing and staging environments using fakes.
Fakes:

- Mimic functionality of the third party API and internal state management without needing any physical devices.
- Enable reliable local testing.
- Enable staging environments for customers.
- Allow comparing API responses to look for discrepancies, reducing maintenance burden.

Read more about the difference between fakes, mocks and stubs in [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/346440/559475).

## Implementing a Fake

The fake will be automatically published to Github Packages as an NPM module, using npm-semantic-release.

This template uses the following:

- [EdgeSpec](https://github.com/seamapi/edgespec) for API routes.
- Zustand for state management.
- AVA for tests.

The fakes should implement the following interfaces:

- Start one or more HTTP servers on a provided port.
- Create or manipulate internal state (without using the API directly) to configure test fixtures,
  e.g., create a user, create an API key, create a sample device.
- Save and load internal state.

## Fake Checklist

- [ ] Fill in package name at `lib/logger.ts` and `pages/api/health.ts`
- [ ] Insomnia Export JSON File in `research/insomnia_config.json`
- [ ] Has README with instructions: how it works, links to relevant third party documentation or blogs, feature list, etc.
- [ ] Implements minimal set of endpoints needed to poll devices and perform actions.
- [ ] Added to [Seam Connect fake config map](https://github.com/seamapi/seam-connect/blob/main/lib/sandbox/fake-config-map.ts).
- [ ] Sample DB data imported into [seam-connect's sample-scenarios folder](https://github.com/seamapi/seam-connect/tree/main/lib/sandbox/sample-scenarios).
- [ ] Any environment variables, e.g., `MANUFACTURER_BASE_URL` added to seam-connect README and `getWorkspaceEnv` file.

## Development and Testing

### Quickstart

```
$ git clone https://github.com/seamapi/fake-template.git
$ cd fake-template
$ nvm install
$ npm install
$ npm run test:watch
```

Primary development tasks are defined under `scripts` in `package.json`
and available via `npm run`.
View them with

```
$ npm run
```

### Source code

The [source code] is hosted on GitHub.
Clone the project with

```

### Requirements

You will need [Node.js] with [npm] and a [Node.js debugging] client.

Be sure that all commands run under the correct Node version, e.g.,
if using [nvm], install the correct version with

```
$ nvm install
```

Set the active version for each shell session with

```
$ nvm use
```

Ensure you are authenticated with the [GitHub Packages npm registry],
then install the development dependencies with

```
$ npm install
```

[Node.js debugging]: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[nvm]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
[GitHub Packages npm registry]: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages

### Publishing

#### Automatic

New versions are released automatically with [semantic-release]
as long as commits follow the [Angular Commit Message Conventions].

[Angular Commit Message Conventions]: https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format
[semantic-release]: https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/

#### Manual

Publish a new version by triggering a [version workflow_dispatch on GitHub Actions].
The `version` input will be passed as the first argument to [npm-version].

This may be done on the web or using the [GitHub CLI] with

```
$ gh workflow run version.yml --raw-field version=<version>
```

[GitHub CLI]: https://cli.github.com/
[npm-version]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version
[version workflow_dispatch on GitHub Actions]: https://github.com/seamapi/fake-template/actions?query=workflow%3Aversion
